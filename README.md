# SpeakGelato
This project is based on the <a href="https://github.com/amzn/alexa-skills-kit-js/tree/master/samples/ChemistryFlashCards" target="_blank">Chemistry Flash Cards</a> and includes the following modifications: 
- Custom card titles and content (in the <a href="http://alexa.amazon.com" target="_blank">Alexa app</a>)
- Only produces cards on wrong answers (so you're only carrying "don't knows" for review)
- Plays audio files
- Uses SSML to wrap audio files
